Deliverables: -

Create the /add-product route which shows a form. Once user has filled , console log it after parsing it using bodyparser.
What is the body parser used for?
Now add one more input tag in the add product page so that user can input size of the product.
When the user clicks on submit parse both the input tags and show it in console.
